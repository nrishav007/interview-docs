Optimizing images =>
    Optimizing images refers to reducing the file size of an image while maintaining its quality, to make it load faster on websites and use less storage space. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as compressing the image, reducing its dimensions, and converting it to an appropriate format (e.g. JPEG or PNG). Optimizing images can improve website performance, user experience and reduce bandwidth costs.

minifying code =>
    Minifying code refers to the process of removing unnecessary characters (such as white spaces, new lines, comments, etc.) from the source code of a program or script, making it smaller and more compact. The goal of minifying code is to reduce the size of the code, which can improve the loading time and performance of web pages or applications.

    Minifying code is particularly useful for client-side scripts such as JavaScript or CSS, as the smaller file size can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the server to the client, resulting in faster load times for the user.
    It's important to note that minifying code does not affect its functionality, only the readability of the code, as the original source code is not intended to be read by humans, but by computers. So, minifying code is typically performed as a final step before deploying an application to a production environment.

caching =>
    Caching is a technique of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area (known as a cache) to reduce the number of times the data must be retrieved from its original source. This can result in faster access times and improved overall performance, especially when the original data source is slow or over a network.

    There are different types of caching, including:

        Browser caching: When a user visits a website, their browser can cache certain elements, such as images and stylesheets, so that they don't have to be re-downloaded every time the user visits the same page.

        Server caching: This involves storing the output of dynamic pages, such as those generated by a content management system, in a cache so that they don't have to be re-generated for each request.

        CDN caching: Content Delivery Networks (CDN) cache static assets, such as images and videos, on servers distributed around the world, so that they can be delivered to users from a server that is geographically closer to them, resulting in faster load times.

    By reducing the number of times data needs to be retrieved from its original source, caching can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of web pages and applications.
